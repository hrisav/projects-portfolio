[Project 3 : Google Playstore Apps Rating Prediction](https://github.com/hrisav/playstore-app-rating-prediction)
--

* Created an app that will predict the ratings of new android apps.
* It will help the android developers to understand the factors behind the rating of any app.
* Data cleaning was done in the first step.
* Extensive EDA was performed.
* Tried to understand univariate and bivariate analysis of the features.
* Analysis was done to understand how each of the category of the app is performing.
* Performed various hypothesis tests.
* Applied OLS and tried to check autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity.
* Applied Random Forest Regressor, Linear Regression, Support Vector Regressor to select the final model.
* Model with least RMSE score was opted.
* Frontend development using HTML, CSS.
* Deployment using Amazon EC2.

[Project 4 : Loan Approval](https://github.com/hrisav/loan-acceptance)
--

* Created an app that will predict if a customer is eligible for loan or not.
* Data cleaning was done to fill missing values with mean/median.
* Exploratory Analysis was performed to understand how other features are related to the target.
* Feature engineering was done and new feature Total Income was formulated.
* One Hot Encoding and Label Encoding was performed on Categorical features.
* Relevant features were selected and MinMaxScaler was applied.
* Applied Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression to select the final model.
* Model with highest accuracy score was opted.
* UI building using HTML, CSS.
* Deployment using Amazon EC2.

[Project 5 : Spam Classifier](https://github.com/hrisav/spam-ham)
--

* Built a binary classification model to detect whether a text message is spam or ham.
* Used NLP techniques likes Lemmatization, Bag of Words, TFIDF as a baseline for ML model building.
* Machine Learning models were built using Naive Bayes, KNeighborsClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, SVM Classifier.
* For Deep Learning, techniques like Tokenizing, Word Indexing, Sequencing, Padding were followed.
* It was then passed through either the Dense network or LSTM network.
* Among ML models, SVM Classifier using TFIDF gave best result in terms of precision, accuracy and f1-score.
* Among DL models, Dense network performed better in terms of validation loss and accuracy.

[Project 6 : Customer Segmentation for RFM analysis](https://github.com/hrisav/Customer-Segmentation)
--

* Understanding a retail store's customer purchase data having 51,243 transactions.
* Generating Recency, Frequency, Amount features for RFM analysis.
* Built a 4-segment solution (using K-Means).
* Building segments from the managerial implementation angle.
* Suggesting marketing and promotional activities based on segements.

[Project 7 : Marketing Mix Modeling](https://github.com/hrisav/FMCG-regression)
--

- Understanding dataset having: Price of Brand X, Feature (value-added variant is present or not), Display (if any promo is present) and its competitor's prices.
- Perform OLS Regression using all features.
- Check significance of features (by P-value) and drop insignifant ones and do OLS again.
- Try feature engineering and check interaction effect between variables and make new features.
- Check adjusted R score and mean absolute error.
- Perform model building using DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, KNeighborsRegressor.
- Also perform hyperparameter tuning and apply crossvalidation for best result.

* Understanding the problem and setting up Spark environment.
* Data cleaning was done to fill missing values with mean/median.
* Exploratory Analysis was performed to understand how other features are related to the target.
* Feature engineering was done and new feature Total Income and EMI was formulated.
* String Indexing and One Hot Encoding was performed on Categorical features.
* Using Vector Assembler multiple columns were merged into a vector column.
* Applied Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression to select the final model.
* Model with highest accuracy score was opted.
